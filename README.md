# IPv6DB

## A RESTful Web service for IPv6 related data [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MichelBoucey/IPv6DB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MichelBoucey/IPv6DB)

IPv6DB is a RESTful microservice using Redis as backend to store lists of IPv6 addresses and attach to each of them data in a schema-free JSON value. Each resource can be permanent or TTLed.

See [IPv6DB APIv1](https://github.com/MichelBoucey/IPv6DB/blob/master/IPv6DB_APIv1.md).

## No release yet! Work In Progress.
